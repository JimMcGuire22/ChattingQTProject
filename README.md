# ChattingQTProject
# This is a project that uses QT and C++ to create a chatting program that will start as a way to chat between two Terminals.
# In the Future it is intended to be expanded into what I see as a good chat app.  Possibly being able to be ran via a server so other computers can talk to one another.
